# Docker workshop ü¶à

## Dockerize project:

to dockerize your project you need to create dockerfile that contains instructions for container

- dockerfile üìÉ:

  ```
  FROM ImageName

  WORKDIR src/app/

  # copy your project to workdir relative path :
  COPY . .

  #command that run when you build your image
  RUN executable parameter

  # change user from root to yourUser
  USER yourUser

  # Define the network ports that this container will listen on at runtime.

  EXPOSE portProject

  # command that running when container started
  CMD ['executable','parameter']

  ```

**note: Application automatically start in production mode**

when you create dockerfile all you need now is building your image

```
docker build -t Tag-of-image path-of-dockerfile
```

now start your image üê≤

```
docker run -p your-network-port:port-of-container image-name-or-container-id
```

## Why we need docker-compose üéº:

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application‚Äôs services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
